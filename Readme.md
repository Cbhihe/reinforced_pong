## Machine Learning project

### First step: Select a topic

Let's discuss some ideas in order to choose one for the project. 
We can sort them by the type of problem they try to solve:

* Supervised (we need labeled data)
    * Classification
    * Regression

* Unsupervised
    * Clustering
    * Dimensionality reduction
    * Density estimation

* Semi-supervised
    * Ranking
    * Reinforcement
